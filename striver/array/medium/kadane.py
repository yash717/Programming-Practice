"""The given problem asks us to find the subarray with the largest sum in an integer array nums and return the sum of that subarray.

To solve this problem, we can use the Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.

The Kadane's algorithm works as follows:

Initialize two variables max_sum and current_sum to track the maximum sum found so far and the sum of the current subarray, respectively. Set both variables to the first element of the array.
Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
a. Update current_sum as the maximum value between the current element and the sum of the current element and current_sum.
b. Update max_sum as the maximum value between max_sum and current_sum.
After the iteration, max_sum will hold the maximum subarray sum.
Here's the code that implements the above steps with detailed comments:

def maxSubArray(nums):
    # Step 1: Initialize variables
    max_sum = nums[0]  # Initialize max_sum with the first element of the array
    # Initialize current_sum with the first element of the array
    current_sum = nums[0]

    # Step 2: Iterate through the array
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):  # Start iterating from the second element
        # Step 2a: Update current_sum
        # Take the maximum between the current element and the sum of the current element and current_sum
        current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])

        # Step 2b: Update max_sum
        # Take the maximum between max_sum and current_sum and update max_sum if necessary
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

    # Step 3: Return the maximum subarray sum
    return max_sum  # Return the maximum subarray sum found


"""You can call the maxSubArray function with the array nums to find the sum of the subarray with the largest sum.

Note: The code assumes that the input array nums is a list of integers and has at least one element."""
